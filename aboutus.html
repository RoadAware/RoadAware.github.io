        <h1>About Us</h1>
            <center>
            <p>We are a group of sophmores from University High School, Normal IL. Our Names are Logan Turner, Brendan Kaft, Brody Henderson, and our mentor Matt Funk. We are working on a project for state farm, our assigned project is road awareness and safety. Our app will allow you to use a GPS mapping system similar to google maps, but it will alert you of upcoming traffic controls, like stop signs, etc. This way you will stay safe and drive legally in unfamiliar territory. </p></center>

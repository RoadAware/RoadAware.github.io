    <h2><u>Current Goals</u></h2>
    <p>Our overall goal as a company is to provide people with a safe and secure way of driving on the roads.  In order to understand this issue, we decided to find statistics relating to car accidents and other incidents so we can figure out how we can implement a digital app to lower these statistics over time.  As a result, we founded RoadAware, an app where you are provided significant details regarding urban and unfamiliar areas.  This was because we found a surprising statistic pertaining to stop sign; stating that about ¼ of drivers actually stopped at crossroads with stop signs.</p>

          </center>
    <p>We will first start with pinpointing stop signs, specifically ones that may be potentially hard to see.  This should help inform drivers when driving in a rural area that they do not know very well about potential hidden stop signs.  If we have the resources and time, we will then add on to it by adding descriptions and other important features to our app. This can include other permanent signs such as warning signs to temporary signs such as construction signs.  Further work that can be done is add a description of a specific location containing any useful information about it. </p>

    <h2><u>Future Goals</u></h2>
    <p>If we were to accomplish these things then we will finally finish things by developing our app to where it is accessible to the whole globe. But since we are a small company, we only intend to commit this app to our local area in Bloomington, Illinois.  One way of doing this would be completed through user inputed tool to where people who discover or would like to add on to our app, then they could do so through a user input option.</p>
